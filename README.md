# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
I have been requested by Tom and Seth from Colorado to help them count and organize votes for a local election. Since they know I am an expert with the Python language, they are asking me to apply my Pyhton skills to write a script. The objectives of this script are to report the total votes cast, the amount of votes per candidate, the percentage of votes per candidate, the winning vote count, and the winning percentage of the victorious candidate.
